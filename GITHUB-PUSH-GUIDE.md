## 📝 Step 2: Create GitHub Repository

   - Click the **"+"** icon (top right)
   - Click **"New repository"**

3. **Fill in Details:**
   - **Repository name:** `intelligent-systems`
   - **Description:** `AI-powered business solutions website with React frontend and Express/PostgreSQL backend`
   - **Visibility:** Choose:
     - ✅ **Public** - Anyone can see (recommended for portfolio)
     - 🔒 **Private** - Only you can see
   - **DO NOT** check these boxes:
     - ❌ Add a README file
     - ❌ Add .gitignore
     - ❌ Choose a license
   - (We already have these files)

4. **Click "Create repository"**

5. **Copy the commands shown** - You'll see something like:
